"No suitable datasets. The five provided datasets (Gestaltungssatzung, Erhaltungssatzung, SatzungBauGB, Stadt, UmlegungsGebiete) are planning/regulatory layers and only offer geometry-derived metrics (e.g., SHAPE__Area and SHAPE__Length with means such as Dataset1 ~7.26e6, Dataset2 ~3.82e5, Dataset3 ~2.60e5, Dataset4 ~5.53e8, Dataset5 ~2.89e5) rather than land-cover classifications or high-resolution imagery, so they cannot inform the spatial resolution needed to distinguish grass patches at the city scale. Nulls and uneven field completeness (e.g., ENTWURF_AUSLEGUNG in Dataset2, BEGRUENDUNG in Dataset5) further limit reliability. Temporal and status information is epidemiologically inconsistent across datasets, reinforcing that these data cannot answer the question; to assess required resolution for grass-area mapping in Chemnitz, obtain explicit grass-land-cover data or high-resolution classified imagery (e.g., drone or Sentinel-2 with ground-trtruth) beyond these datasets."
