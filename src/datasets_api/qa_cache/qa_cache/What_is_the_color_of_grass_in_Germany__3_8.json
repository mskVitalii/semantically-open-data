"Findings and feasibility: The provided Chemnitz datasets do not include explicit CORINE or ATKIS/ALKIS land-cover classes, so direct alignment cannot be quantified from them alone; however the Flaechennutzungsplan dataset (Dataset 5) offers per-feature land-use categories (properties.NUTZUNG, properties.NUTZUNG_LANG, properties.NUTZNR) and parcel areas (properties.SHAPE__Area) across 2000 features (mean SHAPE__Area = 248,979.53; min 434.83; 25th percentile 21,098.86; 75th percentile 149,021.38; max 19,197,595.22), which can be used to approximate grass/green-space shares once a formal crosswalk to CORINE/ALKIS is established; in contrast, Schutzgebiete_Flaechen (Dataset 2) and UmlegungsGebiete (Dataset 3) provide spatial context but do not expose land-cover classes, and Baeume (Dataset 1) documents tree locations (e.g., PFLANZDATUM) without grass-area extents. Data quality notes: Dataset 5 shows complete non-null values for NUTZUNG fields, but Dataset 2 contains substantial nulls in several fields and Dataset 1 has some nulls in PFLANZDATUM, indicating incomplete attributes beyond area, which constrains cross-dataset checks. Temporal context: Dataset 5 reflects a static plan snapshot (AKTDATUM fixed; described as in effect since 24.10.2001), so changes over time are not captured here. Actionable implication: to quantify alignment with grass areas, construct a crosswalk mapping Flaechennutzungsplan.NUTZUNG/NUTZUNG_LANG to CORINE/ALKIS classes using external standard mappings, then sum SHAPE__Area for grass-relevant categories and compare with corresponding CORINE/ALKIS grass-area shares; optionally validate with the tree canopy context from Dataset 1 and green-space layers from Dataset 2 to assess urban green corridors in Chemnitz."
